# NeuralNetwork from Scratch using Numpy

I am trying to implement a basic neural network model from scratch using `numpy` and with different activation functions at hidden layer. 

This notebook contains following sections.

1. Load input data
2. Initializing weights and bias
3. Activation Functions
4. Feed forward propagation
5. Cost calculation
6. Back propagation
7. Update parameters
8. Conclusion
